While we appreciate all efforts to help individuals{{ user }}, when multiple people join a conversation it can often get confusing for those asking for help. Members may be trying to lead someone down a particular thought process to get to the answer and interrupting can break this. 

As a general guideline, try to avoid interrupting ongoing help scenarios unless:
• You feel incorrect information is being given.
• The question has subjective answers.
• The original helper is no longer responding.

You can of course always add additional information after the initial problem has been solved.
