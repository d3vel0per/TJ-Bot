**Getting started with IntelliJ**
To install IntelliJ go to <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>{{ user }}, scroll down and select `Community` (if you are a student you can get the ultimate edition for free by getting the github student developer pack, see `^?gsdp` for more info).

Afterwards see <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-for-the-first-time.html> for instructions on how to install and configure IntelliJ.

Once you've done that you can use <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html#get-started> to create and run your first program.
